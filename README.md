# dragonFM
This commandline Filemanager is special made for accessibility and screenreader needs. 
to avoid stuff like hilight tracking, multisplitt windows and stuff with confusing information (like overlay menus).
thats why it is designed how it looks lilke.
dragonFM is plugin driven and fully configurable and supports:

- Folder navigation
- open files in CLI based on mimetypes
- tab navigation
- context menu (WIP)
- search
- simple keybindings (similar to GUI filemanagers)

It is essential that whatever we use be Unicode-compatible, because we will have both left to right and right to left languages, as well as languages with non-Western alphabets. It must also be console-based and work well and efficiently on a Raspberry Pi 3B Plus running Arch Linux.

# known bugs
(BUG): Control+w to close current tab if there are multiple tabs opened, or close entire file manager if just one tab is opened, just like Firefox.

# general (Priority)
# Context menu (Priority)
(WIP): Shift+F10 usually gives you options like compressing file or directory, open, open-with, e-mailing as an attachment, uncompressing, etc. It should be different depending on file type, and we need to be able to modify this on a conf file or something.
(WIP): It should also be possible to activate the option one wants by pressing a letter which we define as the shortcut letter, just like we do with main menu etc on pdmenu. So in a menu of any kind where you can hear:
for an example see below in "example context menu"

# Search (mid priority)
(Todo): Find a file containing (Control+Shift+F)
  The first looks for a file based on the filename or filename segment you are prompted to type, and the second does a search for files which contain the string which you are prompted to type. Ideal situation here would be to use Recoll, which is apparently an excellent cli search engine, and is already installed in F123Light, but needs a nice easy way to use it.
  Searches are performed on current directory and all sub directories by default.

# Process View (mid Priority)
(Todo): show current copy / move processes
(Todo): be able to abbort them
(Todo): unique API to handle processes/ threads
(Todo): convert all commands with wait potential to this API
(Todo): Find currently blocks mainloop - make listManager loading async

# Main Menu (low priority)
(Todo): Menu
(Todo): F10 should take you to menu of file manager if it has one. If not, maybe it can take you to our Static Menu, if we are not using Virtual menu.
(Todo): Content of Main Menu needs to be specified

# Others (low Priority)
(Todo): Lastly, it would be great for us to be able to deal with remote directories, i.e. via sftp, sshFS, etc, in basically the same interface we use for local directories.

______ToDo_Lutz______
# input (Priority)
(Todo): add basic tab completion to location mode in dialog (autocomplete)
(Todo): add posibility to spawn dialog from threads
(Todo): add posibiltiy to pass return value back to the thread
